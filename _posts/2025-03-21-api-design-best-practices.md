# API Design Best Practices for Robust Backend Systems

Creating well-designed APIs is essential for building maintainable and scalable backend systems. In this post, I'll share key principles that have guided my approach to API design.

## Core Principles

### 1. Consistency Is Key

Consistency in your API design makes your interfaces predictable and easier to use:

- Use consistent naming conventions (e.g., `snake_case` or `camelCase`)
- Maintain consistent URL patterns
- Apply consistent error handling

### 2. Use Proper HTTP Methods

```
GET    - Retrieve resources
POST   - Create resources
PUT    - Replace resources
PATCH  - Update resources partially
DELETE - Remove resources
```

### 3. Implement Proper Status Codes

```python
# Good practice
def create_user(request):
    try:
        # Create user logic
        return JsonResponse(user_data, status=201)  # Created
    except ValidationError:
        return JsonResponse({"error": "Invalid data"}, status=400)  # Bad Request
    except DuplicateError:
        return JsonResponse({"error": "User exists"}, status=409)  # Conflict
```

## Versioning Your API

Always version your APIs to allow for evolution without breaking existing clients:

```
https://api.example.com/v1/users
https://api.example.com/v2/users
```

## Pagination for Large Datasets

```json
{
  "data": [
    { "id": 1, "name": "Item 1" },
    { "id": 2, "name": "Item 2" }
  ],
  "pagination": {
    "total": 50,
    "page": 1,
    "per_page": 10,
    "next": "/api/items?page=2",
    "prev": null
  }
}
```

## Security Considerations

- Always use HTTPS
- Implement proper authentication (OAuth, JWT)
- Apply rate limiting to prevent abuse

```python
# Example rate limiting middleware in Django
class RateLimitMiddleware:
    def __init__(self, get_response):
        self.get_response = get_response
        self.cache = {}
        
    def __call__(self, request):
        ip = request.META.get('REMOTE_ADDR')
        current_time = time.time()
        
        # Clear old requests
        self.cache = {k: v for k, v in self.cache.items() 
                     if current_time - v[-1] < 60}
        
        # Check if IP is in cache
        if ip in self.cache:
            requests = self.cache[ip]
            if len(requests) >= 100:  # 100 requests per minute
                return JsonResponse(
                    {"error": "Too many requests"}, 
                    status=429
                )
            requests.append(current_time)
        else:
            self.cache[ip] = [current_time]
            
        return self.get_response(request)
```

## Documentation Is Not Optional

Good documentation includes:

- Request/response examples
- Authentication details
- Error scenarios
- Rate limiting information

Tools like Swagger/OpenAPI make this process more manageable.

## Conclusion

Following these best practices will help you create APIs that are a pleasure to use and maintain. Remember that a well-designed API is an investment that pays dividends throughout the lifecycle of your application.
