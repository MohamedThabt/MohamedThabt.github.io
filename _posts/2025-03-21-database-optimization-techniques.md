# Database Optimization Techniques Every Backend Developer Should Know

As backend systems scale, database performance often becomes a critical bottleneck. In this post, I'll share practical optimization techniques I've applied throughout my career.

## Indexing Strategies

### When to Index

Indexes dramatically improve query performance but come with trade-offs:

```sql
-- Create an index on frequently queried columns
CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);

-- Create a composite index for queries with multiple conditions
CREATE INDEX idx_products_category_price ON products(category_id, price);
```

**Remember**: Indexes speed up `SELECT` queries but slow down `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operations.

### Query Analysis with EXPLAIN

Always analyze your queries to understand their execution plans:

```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'user@example.com';
```

## Normalization vs. Denormalization

### Normalization Benefits
- Reduces data redundancy
- Ensures data integrity
- Minimizes update anomalies

### When to Denormalize
- Read-heavy workloads
- Complex joins impacting performance
- Reporting and analytics queries

```sql
-- Denormalized table example
CREATE TABLE order_details (
  order_id INT,
  product_id INT,
  product_name VARCHAR(100),  -- Denormalized from products table
  product_price DECIMAL(10,2), -- Denormalized from products table
  quantity INT
);
```

## Query Optimization

### Avoid SELECT *

```sql
-- Bad practice
SELECT * FROM users JOIN orders ON users.id = orders.user_id;

-- Good practice
SELECT users.id, users.name, orders.id, orders.total 
FROM users JOIN orders ON users.id = orders.user_id;
```

### Use JOINs Wisely

```sql
-- Potentially inefficient with large tables
SELECT * FROM table1 
JOIN table2 ON table1.id = table2.table1_id
JOIN table3 ON table2.id = table3.table2_id;

-- Consider breaking into smaller queries if appropriate
```

## Database Caching

Implement caching at different levels:

```python
# Example using Redis for query caching in Python
def get_user_data(user_id):
    # Try to get from cache first
    cache_key = f"user:{user_id}"
    cached_data = redis_client.get(cache_key)
    
    if cached_data:
        return json.loads(cached_data)
    
    # If not in cache, query database
    user_data = db.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = %s", (user_id,))
    
    # Store in cache for future requests (expire after 5 minutes)
    redis_client.setex(cache_key, 300, json.dumps(user_data))
    
    return user_data
```

## Connection Pooling

Manage database connections efficiently:

```python
# Using connection pooling with SQLAlchemy
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.pool import QueuePool

engine = create_engine(
    'postgresql://user:password@localhost/mydb',
    poolclass=QueuePool,
    pool_size=5,
    max_overflow=10,
    pool_timeout=30
)
```

## Database Sharding

For very large datasets, consider horizontal partitioning:

```
# Conceptual example of sharding by user_id
if user_id % 4 == 0:
    return database_shard_1
elif user_id % 4 == 1:
    return database_shard_2
elif user_id % 4 == 2:
    return database_shard_3
else:
    return database_shard_4
```

## Monitoring and Maintenance

Regular maintenance tasks to keep databases running smoothly:

```sql
-- Rebuild indexes to reduce fragmentation
REINDEX TABLE large_table;

-- Update statistics for query optimizer
ANALYZE large_table;

-- Find slow queries
SELECT query, calls, total_time, mean_time
FROM pg_stat_statements
ORDER BY mean_time DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## Conclusion

Database optimization is an ongoing process that requires regular monitoring and refinement. By applying these techniques, you can significantly improve your application's performance and scalability.
