# AI Agents — When, How, and What to Build

Before diving into building an AI agent, it's critical to determine whether your problem actually *requires* one. Agents add complexity, cost, and potential failure points. If a simpler approach works, use it.

---

## Do You Need an AI Agent?

Agents shine in specific scenarios. Before committing to one, evaluate whether the problem truly demands dynamic decision-making and tool orchestration.

### Decision Rules

**1. If the task is deterministic (same input → same output, no side effects) → no agent needed.**

Example: Formatting a JSON object to a specific layout is deterministic. A template or simple function suffices.

**2. If the task sometimes requires calling external services or functions (search, DB query, API calls) → agent recommended.**

Example: A customer support tool that needs to check live order status, fetch shipping info, and process refunds dynamically.

**3. If you always call the same tools and always in the same sequence with a constant number of LLM calls → you may not need a full agent.**

Example: A translator that always uses one LLM call + post-processing. An orchestrated pipeline is simpler and more predictable.

**4. If the task requires dynamic decision-making (decide whether to call tool A or B, iterate based on results) or multi-step planning → agent needed.**

Example: Automating an onboarding workflow that checks identity, creates accounts, verifies payments, and schedules meetings based on different conditions.

## AI Agent — Core Components

An AI Agent is composed of multiple cooperating pieces working in concert. Here's a clear breakdown and visual diagram.

### Components Overview

- **LLM (Reasoning Engine)**: Understands tasks, reasons, and decides next steps. Parses goals, generates plans, produces tool calls.
- **Prompt Templates & Reasoning Strategy**: Structured system prompt + templates that guide LLM behavior and thinking patterns.
- **Tools & Actions**: Functions/APIs the agent can call (search, run code, write files, etc.).
- **Memory & State Management**: Short-term and long-term storage for context, variables, and workflow progress.
- **Control Loop**: The logic deciding whether to continue, call a tool, or finish.

### Components Architecture Diagram

## 1. LLM — The Brain of the Agent

### Role & Capabilities

The LLM is responsible for:

- Parsing natural-language goals into internal representations
- Producing plans (short or multi-step reasoning)
- Deciding when to call tools and how to interpret their outputs
- Communicating results back to users in natural language

### Real Example

**Scenario**: User asks, "Create a deployment checklist and provision a staging server."

**LLM should:**
1. Validate constraints (quota, permissions, environment)
2. Generate a step-by-step plan
3. Call infrastructure APIs (tool) to provision the server
4. Monitor provisioning status
5. Report completion and provide next steps

---

## 2. Prompt Templates & Reasoning Strategies

Prompt templates are predesigned text structures you feed the LLM. Combine them with **reasoning strategies** — patterns that structure how the LLM thinks and acts.

### Common Reasoning Strategies

#### a. ReAct (Reason + Act)

Interleaves reasoning and actions. The LLM emits: thought → action → observation → next thought.

**Example snippet:**

```
Thought: I should check the docs to confirm API rate limits.
Action: search_api_docs("service rate limits")
Observation: "Rate limit = 100 req/min"
Thought: Now I'll adjust the plan to batch requests in chunks of 50.
Action: call_api_batch(requests, batch_size=50)
```

**Benefits**: Clear reasoning trail, easy to debug, good for complex tasks.

#### b. Plan-and-Execute

Separate planning phase from execution phase. The agent first generates a full plan, then executes steps deterministically.

**Example:**

```
PLAN: 
  Step 1: Summarize repo structure
  Step 2: Run tests
  Step 3: Fix linter errors
  Step 4: Commit changes

EXECUTE: 
  Run Step 1 → return summary
  Run Step 2 → check for failures
  Run Step 3 → run linter fix tool
  Run Step 4 → commit with git tool
```

**Benefits**: Predictable execution, easier to audit, good for structured workflows.

#### c. Reflection (Self-Improvement)

After actions, the agent analyzes outcomes and updates its future behavior within the same session or stores learnings.

**Example:**

```
Action: search("Python async best practices")
Observation: Results don't match my query intent.

Reflection: "My search terms were too narrow (only 'async'). 
Next time, expand query to 'Python concurrent programming async await' 
to capture coroutines, asyncio, and related patterns."
```

**Benefits**: Adaptive behavior, continuous improvement, better second attempts.

#### d. Tree-of-Thoughts (Advanced)

Enumerate multiple possible reasoning paths, score them, and select the best.

**Use case**: Complex problem-solving where exploring alternatives significantly improves results.

**Example**: Before choosing a database architecture, the agent explores 3 options (SQL, NoSQL, NewSQL), scores them against requirements, and picks the best fit.

---

## 3. Tools & Actions

Tools are the functions the agent can call. Implement them as safe, well-typed interfaces with clear input/output contracts.

### Common Tools and Examples

| Tool | Signature | Use Case |
|------|-----------|----------|
| **Web Search** | `search(query) → URLs & snippets` | Fact-checking, research, real-time info |
| **Code Execution** | `run_code(language, code) → output/errors` | Test patches, validate logic |
| **File Operations** | `read_file(path)`, `write_file(path, content)` | Update docs, generate reports |
| **API Calls** | `call_payment_api(payload)` | Charge customers, fetch order status |
| **Database Query** | `query_db(sql_or_params) → results` | RAG retrieval, user profiles |
| **Email/Notifications** | `send_email(to, subject, body)` | Notify users, escalate alerts |
| **Code Analysis** | `analyze_code(repo_url) → issues & suggestions` | Linting, security scanning |
| **Deployment** | `deploy_service(image, config) → deployment_id` | Infrastructure automation |

### Design Tips

- **Validate and sandbox every tool**. Never expose raw system commands to LLM outputs.
- **Clear error handling**: Return structured errors (not stack traces) so LLM can understand and retry.
- **Rate limiting**: Protect external services by enforcing quotas per agent execution.
- **Audit logging**: Log every tool invocation with inputs, outputs, and actor info.

---

## 4. Memory & State Management

Memory and state prevent context loss and enable multi-step workflows. There are two types:

### Short-Term Memory

**Purpose**: Maintain immediate conversation or workflow context.

**Example**: Summarize the last 5 messages into a `conversation_summary` that is prepended to the next LLM prompt. This keeps the context window manageable while preserving intent.

**Implementation**: Store in-memory or in fast caches (Redis).

### Long-Term Memory

**Purpose**: Persist user preferences, profiles, or documents across sessions.

**Example**: Store user preference `{preferred_language: "Arabic"}` or a knowledge base indexed for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).

**Implementation**: Database, vector store (Chroma, FAISS, Pinecone).

### RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

Store embeddings/indices of documents. When the user asks a question:
1. Retrieve relevant chunks (via semantic search)
2. Include them in the LLM prompt
3. LLM reasons over the retrieved context

**Benefits**: Cost reduction (smaller context window), accuracy (use authoritative docs), freshness (easy to update indexed docs).

---

## 5. The Control Loop — How Agents Decide Next Steps

The control loop implements the core decision-making: Observe → Decide → Act → Observe.

You **must** implement stopping conditions and limits to prevent runaway behavior.

### Simple Loop Steps

1. **Read current state**: Load conversation history, stored variables, progress.
2. **Append latest input**: Add user's new message or trigger to state.
3. **Check goal achieved**: If stop condition met, return final response.
4. **Call LLM**: Pass prompt + state + available tools.
5. **Parse LLM output**: Extract decisions, tool calls, or final answers.
6. **Execute tools**: If agent chose to call tools, run them.
7. **Observe results**: Append tool outputs to state.
8. **Reflect & iterate**: Optionally reflect on outcomes; repeat until done.

### Control Loop Diagram

![AI Agent Control Loop](/assets/img/posts/ai-agent-control-loop.png)
_The agent control loop showing the decision cycle: Load State  Receive Input  Check Goal  Call LLM  Execute Tools  Update State  Repeat_

### Control Loop: Limits & Safety

To prevent runaway or costly behavior:

- **Max iterations**: e.g., `max_iterations = 20`. Stop if agent hasn't found answer.
- **Max tokens**: Limit tokens per LLM call and total budget to control cost.
- **Max time**: Runtime timeout per step (e.g., 30 seconds).
- **Tool call quotas**: Prevent excessive API usage (e.g., max 5 search calls per session).
- **Hard stop**: If agent stuck for N iterations, escalate to human.

## AI Agent Frameworks (Python-Focused)

### LangChain

**Core features**: Agents, chains, memory, prompts, integrations.

**Best for**: Single-agent flows and RAG applications.

**When to use**: Quick prototyping, connecting to multiple LLM providers, building retrieval pipelines.

```python
from langchain.agents import initialize_agent, Tool
from langchain.llms import OpenAI

tools = [Tool(...), Tool(...)]
agent = initialize_agent(tools, OpenAI(), agent="zero-shot-react-description")
agent.run("Your task here")
```

### LangGraph

**Core features**: Higher-level orchestration, stateful graphs, complex pipelines.

**Best for**: Multi-agent workflows and sophisticated control flows.

**When to use**: Coordinating multiple agents, complex conditionals, visualizing state machines.

### LangFlow

**Core features**: Visual UI to compose flows and agents.

**Best for**: Prototyping and non-developers.

**When to use**: Quick demos, no-code agent building.

### LlamaIndex (formerly GPT Index)

**Core features**: Connecting private data with LLMs (indexing, RAG).

**Best for**: Privacy-critical applications, document-heavy workflows.

**When to use**: Building on your own docs, controlling data flow, minimizing external API calls.

### Crew / AutoGen / Ray-based Multi-Agent Libraries

**Core features**: Orchestrating many agents with specialized roles.

**Best for**: Complex multi-agent systems (researcher, coder, tester, etc.).

**When to use**: Decomposing work across specialized agents, hierarchical reasoning.

---

## Best Tools to Pair with Agents

### Streamlit / Gradio

**What**: Quick interactive UI frameworks.

**Use case**: Build demos, operator dashboards, user override interfaces.

**Why**: Show agent decisions in real-time, allow manual intervention.

### Datastax / Chroma / FAISS

**What**: Vector databases for embeddings.

**Use case**: RAG and long-term semantic memory.

**Why**: Fast retrieval of context for grounding agent reasoning.

### Pandas

**What**: Data manipulation library.

**Use case**: Process CSV outputs from tools before passing to LLM.

**Why**: Clean and normalize tool outputs for consistent LLM input.

### Redis

**What**: Fast in-memory data store.

**Use case**: Ephemeral state, session management, concurrency locks.

**Why**: Scale to multiple agent instances without state conflicts.

### Task Queues (Celery / RQ / Prefect)

**What**: Async task execution.

**Use case**: Offload long-running tasks (infra provisioning, test suites).

**Why**: Keep agent loop responsive while background jobs complete.

## AI Agent Design Patterns

### 1. ReAct Pattern

**What**: Interleaves reasoning and actions.

**Flow**:
- LLM thinks → calls search() → sees results → refines reasoning → calls summarize()

**Best for**: Multi-step reasoning with frequent tool interaction.

**Example**: A research assistant that iteratively refines queries based on search results.

### 2. Plan-and-Execute

**What**: Agent first generates a full plan, then executes steps programmatically.

**Flow**:
- PLAN: List all steps
- EXECUTE: Run steps one-by-one, verifying success

**Best for**: Structured workflows, compliance scenarios.

**Example**: A migration task where PLAN lists schema changes, data validation, rollback steps; EXECUTE runs them in order with checkpoints.

### 3. Multi-Agent Collaboration

**What**: Specialized agents work together (researcher, coder, tester, integrator).

**Flow**:
- Researcher finds design options
- Coder writes implementation
- Tester runs unit tests
- Integrator merges results

**Best for**: Complex projects requiring diverse expertise.

**Example**: Building a feature: one agent researches best practices, another writes code, another tests it, final agent integrates into main branch.

### 4. Agentic RAG

**What**: Agents that dynamically retrieve documents, update local indices, and re-run reasoning with newly indexed info.

**Flow**:
- Agent asks: "What clauses should I include?"
- Tool: retrieve_clauses(context)
- Agent updates knowledge
- Agent re-reasons with new context

**Best for**: Legal, compliance, and document-heavy domains.

**Example**: Legal assistant retrieves relevant clauses, extracts Q&A, and refines answer based on latest precedents.

## Practical Example: Simple Agent Flow (Pseudocode)

```python
def run_agent_loop(user_id, user_input, max_iterations=20):
    state = load_user_state(user_id)
    state.append({"role": "user", "content": user_input})
    
    for i in range(max_iterations):
        # 1. Build prompt
        prompt = build_prompt(
            state=state,
            system_prompt=AGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT,
            tool_descriptions=TOOLS_DESCRIPTION
        )
        
        # 2. Call LLM
        llm_output = call_llm(prompt)
        
        # 3. Check if done
        if llm_output.type == "final_answer":
            save_state(state)
            return llm_output.content
        
        # 4. Execute tool if requested
        if llm_output.type == "tool_call":
            tool_result = call_tool(
                llm_output.tool_name,
                llm_output.args
            )
            state.append({
                "role": "assistant",
                "content": f"Tool: {llm_output.tool_name}",
                "tool_result": tool_result
            })
            
            # Handle errors
            if tool_result.error:
                state.append({
                    "role": "system",
                    "content": f"Error: {tool_result.error}"
                })
        
        # 5. Check for stuck condition
        if stuck_condition(state, i):
            escalate_to_human(state, user_id)
            return "Escalated to human review."
    
    # Max iterations reached
    return "Agent reached max iterations. Escalating..."
```

## Engineering Considerations & Safety

### 1. Sandboxing Tool Execution

**Why**: Prevent arbitrary code execution from untrusted LLM outputs.

**How**:
- Use containers (Docker) for code execution tools
- Restrict filesystem access (read-only mounts)
- Timeout processes after N seconds

### 2. Audit Logs

**Why**: Debugging, compliance, anomaly detection.

**What to log**:
- Every LLM prompt and completion
- Every tool call (inputs, outputs, timing)
- State transitions
- Error conditions

### 3. Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)

**Why**: Critical decisions should be reviewable before execution.

**When**:
- Payment processing
- Account deletions
- Infrastructure changes
- Sensitive data access

**How**: Flag high-risk actions, notify human, wait for approval before executing.

### 4. Rate & Cost Control

**Set budgets**:
- Total token budget per session
- Cost ceiling per user per day
- Fallback: use smaller, cheaper model (SLM) or cached answers if budget exceeded

### 5. Testing AI Agents

**Deterministic tests**: Fixed input + sequence of actions = expected output.

**Fuzz tests**: Vary inputs, check for crashes or nonsensical outputs.

**Integration tests**: Run with real tools in staging, verify tool calls are correct.

**Cost tests**: Track token usage per scenario, alert if trending up.

## Quick Checklist Before Building an Agent

Use this checklist to validate your agent design:

- ✅ **Dynamic tool selection required?** (If not, use a pipeline instead)
- ✅ **Side-effecting calls?** (DB updates, payments — requires HITL)
- ✅ **Multi-step, conditional workflow?** (If not, a simple prompt may suffice)
- ✅ **Clear stop conditions & budgets set?** (Max iterations, tokens, time, cost)
- ✅ **Tools sandboxed and validated?** (No arbitrary code execution)
- ✅ **Logging & observability?** (Every LLM call, every tool call)
- ✅ **HITL for high-risk actions?** (Payments, deletions, sensitive operations)
- ✅ **Testing strategy in place?** (Deterministic + fuzz + integration tests)
- ✅ **Cost forecasted?** (Token usage per interaction, monthly budget)
- ✅ **Escalation path documented?** (When to involve humans)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Evaluate your problem** using the decision flow above — do you really need an agent?
2. **Start simple**: Build a ReAct pattern agent with 2-3 basic tools.
3. **Add safety incrementally**: Logging → HITL → Rate limiting.
4. **Instrument observability**: Dashboards for token usage, tool call frequency, error rates.
5. **Iterate with users**: Gather feedback on agent decisions and refine prompts.

Building production-grade AI agents requires discipline, but the payoff—autonomous reasoning, dynamic tool usage, and multi-step planning—is substantial.
