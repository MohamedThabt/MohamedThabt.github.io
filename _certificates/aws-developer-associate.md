This certification validates my expertise in developing and maintaining applications on the AWS platform. I demonstrated proficiency in writing code for serverless applications, using AWS APIs, AWS CLI, and SDKs to interact with AWS services, and implementing authentication and authorization for applications.

The certification covers key services such as Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3, CloudFormation, and Elastic Beanstalk, along with CI/CD pipelines and security best practices.

During my preparation, I built several projects including a serverless API and a multi-tier web application with proper security configurations and automated deployments.
