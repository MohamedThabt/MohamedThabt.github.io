## Project 1

This is a sample project that demonstrates my skills in backend development and API design. It includes features like user authentication, data processing, and real-time notifications.

### Features

- User authentication with JWT
- Real-time data processing
- Notification system
- RESTful API design
- Containerized deployment

### Implementation Details

The project was implemented using Django and PostgreSQL for data storage. Redis was used as a caching layer and for managing real-time features. The entire application was containerized with Docker for easy deployment.
